     * The MCP server runs as a child process of the native runtime, so it boots with
     * NATIVEPHP_RUNNING set and NativePHP pushes PreventRegularBrowserAccess onto the global
     * middleware while it registers. That middleware answers 403 to every request without the
     * runtime's own cookie or secret header, which no MCP client will ever send.
     *
     * The marker is read with getenv() rather than through config, because a packaged build boots
     * from a cached config and never parses .env — the variable only ever exists in the process
     * environment. Swapping the middleware here rather than in bootstrap/app.php keeps NativePHP's
     * own guard in place for the app window, which is the browser it means to keep out.
     *
     * The guard is replaced rather than removed. `artisan serve` serves the whole application, and
     * the Filament panel sits at the root path with no authentication of its own, so dropping
     * PreventRegularBrowserAccess and putting nothing back would answer the entire app UI on the
     * MCP port. AllowOnlyMcpRequests narrows the process to the one route it exists to serve.
