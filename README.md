## Feature overview
- Manage "Projects" (local repositories)
    - choose to commit or ignore the configuration directory
- Manage "Workspaces" (a specific branch in a worktree)
    - create Workspaces for new or existing branches
    - track a Workspace's status, showing whether a Workspace is `ready` for work or `suspended` (dev environment not running)
    - quickly launch your configured Terminal, IDE, or Browser for a Workspace
    - easily remove a Workspace and clean up the worktree and branch
- Run local Workflows to spin up, tear down, or modify local development environments, per Workspace
    - write Workflows in a style inspired by GitHub Actions (that run locally)
    - use template variables specific to the Project, Workspace, or a value in your `.env` file
    - conditionally run or skip steps based on the outcome of a shell command
    - run nested Workflows
    - validate or launch Workflows from a terminal
- Review Workflow output logs in the application
    - watch output appear in realtime
    - review historical logs
    - diagnose Workflow failures
    - bulk delete old log files

### Local MCP server

- Use your favorite agentic coding tool to control LaborForest
- Configure the local MCP server as read-only or writeable
- Choose whether an agent may run commands through your shell: allow, require your approval, or deny
    - approve a Workflow run or a launch command in the app, seeing exactly what will run
- Manage Projects and Workflows
- Write, run, validate, and diagnose Workflows
- Update configured settings

### Example workflows included

- Kickstart your project with example Workflows
    - Laravel (Herd, MinIO, Redis)
    - JavaScript
    - Bare (starting point)

### System requirements:
- macOS (arm64 or x64)

## Tech stack
- NativePHP + Laravel
- Livewire
- Filament
- TailwindCSS
